Also, learn how to use the correct derivation path for RSK and add RSK as custom node.

## Disclaimer

- Currency may be mistakenly displayed as `ETH` within some screens of MetaMask.
  The RSK network uses `RBTC` as its cryptocurrency.
- This tutorial uses [RSK public nodes](/rsk/public-nodes).
  You can connect to another node by changing the RPC URL.
- The node must enable CORS for browser-based DApps to work.
  - Please review the [configuration file reference](/rsk/node/configure) for CORS settings.
