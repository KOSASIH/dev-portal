The Service Providers will run the _scheduler service_ that will track all new requested transactions and execute them in the correct time

> See [this guide](../run) to run a scheduler on your own

## Architecture

The service works as a _cach√©_ system. It collects information from another source of trust: the smart contract:
- Stores the requested transactions in a Sqlite database (configurable)
- Runs each 5 minutes collecting transactions that need to be executed (configurable)
- Connects to RSK node using web sockets -- it uses _eth_getLogs_ and _eth_subscribe_ RPC methods
- It executes transactions storing a private key in a file -- this can be easily improved
- It has no HTTP API

## Model

It has 5 core components

- Recoverer -- recovers all the requested executions when the service was asleep
- Listener -- notifies the service when new executions are listed
- Collector -- recurrently collects all the transactions that need to be executed
- Scheduler -- sets alarms for collected executions
- Executor -- executes the requested transaction at the given time

The service in designed allowing any of this modules to be switched for different implementations. For example, it is easy to change the _scheduler_ module to implement a different scheduling technique.
