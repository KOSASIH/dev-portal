title: Get your own RIF Lumino node up and running on Ubuntu
---

## Prerequisites

1. Access to a synched RSK node. You can do this in a variety of ways:
  * [Public nodes](/rsk/public-nodes)
  * [Run your own node](/rsk/node/install) on Testnet or Mainnet
  * [Compile and run a RSK node locally](/rsk/node/contribute)
1. An RSK account with an R-BTC balance NOT lower than 0.001 R-BTC
1. Ubuntu 18.04+

## Install required libraries/software

### Install Python 3.7

Update your packages and install pre-requisites:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common
```

Add deadsnakes PPA to your sources list:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
```

Once the repository is enabled install Python 3.7:

```bash
sudo apt install python3.7
```


### Install Python 3.7-dev

If you didn't update your local APT repository:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

To install python 3.7-dev run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev python3.7-dev
```

### Install PIP


If you didn't update your local APT repository:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Install pip3:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

### Install virtualenv

If you didn't update your local APT repository:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Install virtualenv:

```bash
sudo apt-get install virtualenv
```

## Build RIF Lumino from code

1. Get the code from [https://github.com/rsksmart/lumino/releases/tag/0.0.2](https://github.com/rsksmart/lumino/releases/tag/0.0.2)
2. Uncompress the downloaded file
2. Go to the path you uncompressed the code in the previous step (lets call this path `$RIF_LUMINO_PATH`)
3. Create python virtual env for RIF Lumino (this needs to be performed only once) and execute the following command:

```
virtualenv -p <PATH_TO_PYTHON3.7> clientEnv
```

**Note:**
Replace `<PATH_TO_PYTHON3.7>` with the path where Python3.7 is installed in your system. In the case of Ubuntu OS, this is usually `/usr/bin/python3.7`

4. Activate python virtual env, by executing the following command:

```bash
source clientEnv/bin/activate
```

5. Check if the Python version is correct inside the virtual environment by running:

```bash
python --version
```

This command should output version 3.7.x

6. Install RIF Lumino requirements. Inside the virtual environment run the following command (this could take a few minutes):

```bash
pip install -c constraints.txt --upgrade -r requirements-dev.txt
```

7. Run Lumino setup with the following command:

```bash
python setup.py develop
```

## Start your RIF Lumino Node

1. Go to `$RIF_LUMINO_PATH`
2. If you haven't execute it before, run: source ``clientEnv/bin/activate``
3. Run the following command:

```bash
lumino
	 --rnsdomain=$RNS_DOMAIN_OF_YOUR_NODE_ADDRESS
	 --keystore-path $KEYSTORE_PATH
	 --network-id 30
	 --eth-rpc-endpoint $RSK_NODE_URL
	 --environment-type development
	 --tokennetwork-registry-contract-address=0x59ec7ced1e1ee2e4ccc74f197fb680d8f9426b96
	 --secret-registry-contract-address=0x4dea623ae7c5cb1f4af9b46721d9a72d93c42be9
	 --endpoint-registry-contract-address=0x7d1e6f17baa2744b5213b697ae4c1d287bb10df0
	 --no-sync-check
	 --api-address=127.0.0.1:5001

```
