## Multi-Crypto Resolver

In the RNS registry we have launched a resolver capable of resolve addresses from other blockchains using a [`chain id`](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md) as an identifier. With the same restrictions and visibility as the Public Resolver. This resolver implements all the methods described in the [resolver specification](/rif/rns/architecture/Resolver)

### Mainnet information

- **Multi-Crypto Resolver Adrress**: [`0x99a12be4C89CbF6CFD11d1F2c029904a7B644368`](http://explorer.rsk.co/address/0x99a12be4C89CbF6CFD11d1F2c029904a7B644368)
- **ABI**: [MultiCryptoResolverABI.json](/rif/rns/architecture/MultiCryptoResolverABI.json)

See [RNS Testnet section](/rif/rns/testnet) for testing environment information.

**Context**
```js
AbstractRNS rns;
```

- `rns`: the Registry contract

**Storage**
```js
mapping(bytes32=>address) addresses;
mapping(bytes32=>bytes32) hashes;
```

- `adresses`: for each `namehash` entry, stores an address
- `hashes`: for each `namehash` entry, stores a hash

## Methods

#### content
Returns the content hash associated with an RNS node. Note that this resource type is not standardized, and will likely change in future to a resource type based on multihash.

**Signature**
```js
function content(bytes32 node) public view returns (bytes32)
```

**Parameters**
`node`: the RNS node to query.

**Returns**
- `bytes32`: the associated content hash.

#### setContent
Sets the content hash associated with an RNS node. May only be called by the owner of that node in the RNS registry. Note that this resource type is not standardized, and will likely change in future to a resource type based on multihash.

**Signature**
```js
function setContent(bytes32 node, bytes32 hash) public only_owner(node)
```

**Parameters**
- `node`: the node to update.
- `hash`: the content hash to set

## Multi-Crypto Resolver Methods

#### supportsInterface

Returns true if the resolver implements the interface specified by the provided hash.

This Resolver supports
- `0x3b3b57de = sha3(addr(bytes32))`
- `0xd8389dc5 = sha3(content(bytes32))`

**Signature**
```js
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) public pure returns (bool)
```

**Parameters**
- `interfaceID`: the ID of the interface to check for.

**Returns**
- `bool`: true if the contract implements the requested interface.

#### addr

Returns the address associated with an RNS node. Same as calling `chainAddr` with this node and RSK chain id as parameters.

**Signature**
```js
function addr(bytes32 node) public view returns (address)
```

**Parameters**
- `node`: the RNS node to query.

**Returns**
- `string`: the associated address.

#### setAddr
Sets the address associated with an RNS node, using the RSK chain id as default chain. May only be called by the owner of that node in the RNS registry.

**Signature**
```js
function setAddr(bytes32 node, address addrValue) public only_owner(node)
```

**Parameters**
- `node`: the node to update.
- `addrValue`: the address to set.

#### content
Returns the content hash associated with an RNS node. Note that this resource type is not standardized, and will likely change in future to a resource type based on multihash.

**Signature**
```js
function content(bytes32 node) public view returns (bytes32)
```

**Parameters**
`node`: the RNS node to query.

**Returns**
- `bytes32`: the associated content hash.

#### setContent
Sets the content hash associated with an RNS node. May only be called by the owner of that node in  the RNS registry. Note that this resource type is not standardized, and will likely change in future to a resource type based on multihash.

**Signature**
```js
function setContent(bytes32 node, bytes32 hash) public only_owner(node)
```

**Parameters**
- `node`: the node to update.
- `hash`: the content hash to set


#### chainAddr

Returns the address associated with an RNS node for a particular chain id. Using the RSKCHAINID as the default chain if no one is provided.

**Signature**
```js
function chainAddr (bytes32 node, bytes4 chain) public view returns (string memory)
```

**Parameters**
- `node`: the RNS node to query.
- `chainId`: The identifier of the blockchains acording to [`slip-0044`](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md).

**Returns**
`string`: The address associated with the node in the specified chainId. If no chain id, RSKCHAINID will be the default chain if no one is supplied.

#### setChainAddr

Sets the address associated with an RNS node and a chain id. May only be called by the owner of that node in the RNS registry. Emits the `AddrChanged` event if the chainId supplied was RSKCHAINID, otherwise emits `ChainAddrChanged`.


**Signature**
```js
function setChainAddr(bytes32 node, bytes4 chainId, string memory addrValue) public onlyOwner(node)
```

**Parameters**
- `node`: the RNS node to query.
- `chainId`: The identifier of the blockchains acording to [`slip-0044`](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md).
- `addrValue`: The address to set.


#### chainMetadata

Returns the metadata stored in a RNS node for a specified chain id. Emits `ChainMetadataChanged`.

**Signature**
```js
function chainMetadata (bytes32 node, bytes4 chainId)
```

**Parameters**
- `node`: the RNS node to query.
- `chainId`: The identifier of the blockchains acording to [`slip-0044`](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md).
- `addrValue`: The address to set.

**Returns**

The associated metadata with that node.

#### setChainMetadata

Stores metadata associated with a particular RNS node in the specified chain id. Emits an event `ChainMetadataChanged`

**Signature**
```js
function setChainMetadata (bytes32 node, bytes4 chain, bytes32 metadataValue)
```

**Parameters**
- `node`: the RNS node to query.
- `chainId`: The identifier of the blockchains acording to [`slip-0044`](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md).
- `metadataValue`: The data to set.

#### setChainAddrWithMetadata

Its a call to both methods [`setChainAddr`](#setchainaddr) and [`setChainMetadata`](#setchainmetadata)
**Signature**

```js
function setChainAddrWithMetadata (bytes32 node, bytes4 chain, string memory addrValue, bytes32 metadataValue)
```

**Parameters**
- `node`: the RNS node to query.
- `chainId`: The identifier of the blockchains acording to [`slip-0044`](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md).
- `addrValue`: The address to set.
- `metadataValue`: The metadata to set.


## Events

#### ChainAddrChanged

This events should be fired when the method `setChainAddr` is sucessfully called and has to propagate the information, if the chain is the RSKCHAINID, then the `AddrChanged` event is fired, specified in the [Resolver specificaction](/rif/rns/architecture/Resolver):

- `node`: the node to update.
- `addrValue`: the address to set.
- `chainId`: The identifier of the blockchains acording to [`slip-0044`](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md).
