## Supported Addresses

The following address types are supported by the 2 way peg app.

- Segwit:
A SegWit address starts with the number 3 and has more elaborated functionality than a legacy address. Types include P2SH-P2WPKH and P2SH-P2WSH.

- Native segwit:
Also known as Bech32 address, native SegWit looks different from the P2-styles as it starts with bc1.

- Legacy address:
These addresses are the original BTC addresses. It uses a special script hash function called P2PKH (Pay-to-Pubkey Hash) address and starts with the number 1.
