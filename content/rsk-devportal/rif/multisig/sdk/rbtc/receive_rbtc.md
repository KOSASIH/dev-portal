It is important to understand that in order to properly receive funds, the Multisig account address (instead of the owner address) must be used as the receiver.

[](#top "collapsible")
- A) Get the Multisig account address
  * Assuming the Multisig account was created by means of [EthersSafeFactory](/rif/multisig/sdk/creation):

  ```ts
  const safeSdk = await safeFactory.createSafe({
    owners: ['0x1234...', '0xabcd...', '0x0987...'],
    threshold: 2
  })

  // address to use as fund receiver
  const multisigAccountAddress = safeSdk.getAddress()
  ```
  {:.snippet__code.snippet__code--lightgreen}

- B) Send the transaction
  * Here below is an example of a transaction executed for funding the Multisig account using [ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/)
  
  ```ts
  // address to use as fund receiver
  const multisigAccountAddress = safeSdk.getAddress()

  const valueToSend = BigNumber.from("1000000000")
  await signer.sendTransaction({
      to: multisigAccountAddress,
      value: valueToSend
  })
  ```
