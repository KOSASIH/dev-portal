It is important to understand that in order to receive funds, the Multisig account address (instead of the owner's address) must be used as the receiver.

[](#top "collapsible")
- A) Get the Multisig account address
  * Assuming the Multisig account was created by means of [EthersSafeFactory](/rif/multisig/sdk/creation):

  ```ts
  const safeSdk = await safeFactory.createSafe({
    owners: ['0x1234...', '0xabcd...', '0x0987...'],
    threshold: 2
  })

  // address to use as fund receiver
  const multisigAccountAddress = safeSdk.getAddress()
  ```

- B) Transfer ERC20 tokens
  * Assuming we have an ERC20-compliant contract:

  ```ts
  const erc20Token: Contract;
  // address to use as fund receiver
  const multisigAccountAddress = safeSdk.getAddress()

  const valueToSend = BigNumber.from("1000000000")
  await erc20Token.transfer(multisigAccountAddress, valueToSend)
  ```
