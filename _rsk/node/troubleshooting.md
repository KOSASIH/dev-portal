This section explains how to solve some known or frequently encountered issues.

If what you need is not in this section, **please contact us** without hesitation through our [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/rsksmart/rskj). We will be happy to help you!

### Discovery can't be started

On Windows, if you start the node and it doesn't do anything, there is a high chance you have a problem with the UDP port of the node.

The UDP port is configured in the node's configuration file, specifically with the value `peer.port`. By default this port is configured to `5050`.

To check if that port is already taken by other application you can follow these steps:

* Open a `cmd` console and run `netstat -ano -p UDP | findstr :5050` (or replace `5050` with the port of your preference).
* You will get a result with the process ID (if any) already using that port for UDP.
* With the process ID (the value at the far right), run this command `tasklist /FI "PID eq processId-you-got"`.

This will let you know which application/service is using this port.

Please make sure the port of your preference is not taken by other application. If so, you need to change the node configuration [as explained here](/rsk/node/configure/#setting-your-own-config-preferences), by overwriting the [peer](/rsk/node/configure/reference/#peer) port option.

> Note: we are considering the possibility of changing this port (5050) in future releases to avoid this problem.

### I don't see the logs

You can configure your own log level, following these [instructions](/rsk/node/configure/verbosity).

### Plugin with id witness not found

If you have this error it's possible that you have missed to run rskj's dependencies.
So please, follow the instructions depending on your operation system:

- [On Windows](/rsk/node/contribute/windows)
- [On Linux](/rsk/node/contribute/linux)
- [On Mac](/rsk/node/contribute/macos)

### Truffle doesn't seem to work connected to RSK

If you can not get `truffle migrate` complete, you will see something like:

```javascript
Writing artifacts to ./build/contracts
Using network 'development'.
Running migration: 1_initial_migration.js
  Deploying Migrations...
  ... 0xc82d661d579e40d22c732b2162734f97aeb13fa095946927cbb8cd896b26a7a3
```

Be sure you are using the right configuration in the `truffle.js` and `truffle-config.js` files.

Remember that you need: **node host**, **node port**, **network_id** and in some cases the **from** (by default Truffle uses the first account in the node). This last one should be an account with positive balance (because it's the one Truffle uses to deploy contract and run transactions) and it should be present between the node's accounts (you can know that by executing the `web3.eth.accounts` command).

So, your config file should be like this:

``` javascript
module.exports = {
    networks : {
        rsk: {
            from : "0xcd2a3d9f938e13cd947ec05abc7fe734df8dd826",
            host : "localhost",
            port : 4444,
            network_id : "*" // Match any network id
        }
    }
};
```

### The node takes up too much space

The prune service is a process that runs over the node storage to lighten the space it needs to be synchronized. This process removes useless data over a determined amount of blocks processed.

To enable prune service in your node [override your configuration](/rsk/node/configure). These are the recommended parameters:

```
prune {
    # prune service could be enabled or not
    # values: [true/false]
    # default: false
    enabled = true

    # Number of blocks to process
    blocks {
        # Number of blocks to copy in each prune run
        # default: 5000
        toCopy = 5000

        # Number of blocks to wait to run prune again
        # default: 10000
        toWait = 10000

        # Number of blocks to suspend blockchain process
        # in order to avoid forks
        # default: 100
        toAvoidForks = 100
    }
}
```

### Can't get public IP

If you get the error:
`Can't get public IP` when you're trying to run your rskj node, the reason is that rskj uses Amazon Check IP service to set the [`public.ip`](/rsk/node/configure/reference/#publicip) parameter.

To solve it, you need to change the `public.ip` key in config file with your IP address (if you don't know your IP, simply [search for it](https://www.google.com/search?q=what's+my+IP+address)).

[This page](/rsk/node/configure) will show you how to change a node's configuration file.
