After fulfilling the steps *Pre-requisites*, *Get the source code*, *Ensure the security chain* and *Get external dependencies* according to your operating system ([Windows](/rsk/node/contribute/windows), [Linux](/rsk/node/contribute/linux), [Mac](/rsk/node/contribute/macos)), you can compile and run an RSK node from command line following these steps.

## Compiling and running the node

From the root directory where the code was downloaded, execute:

```bash
./gradlew build -x test
```

After building, run:

```bash
java -cp [jar] co.rsk.Start
```

Replace:

- **[jar]**: the path to the fatjar generated by the gradle shadow command. It can be found on `rskj-core/build/libs/rskj-core-{version}-all.jar`.

It's ready!

You are on the Mainnet by default. If you want to switch the networks, read [this page](/rsk/node/configure/switch-network).
