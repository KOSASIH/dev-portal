Here you have the steps to compile and run an RSK node on Windows.

This page is organized in this way:

- [Compiling the node](#compiling-the-node)
- [IDEA Build/Run configuration](#idea-buildrun-configuration)
- [Running the node](#running-the-node)

## Compiling the node

After opening IDEA we need to load the RskJ project, this can be done by using the *Import project* option in IDEA.

To do that follow the next steps:

- Go to *File* -> *New* -> *Project from Existing Sources...*
- Browse in the RskJ downloaded code the file `rskj\build.gradle` and select it.
- Within the dialog select *Use default gradle wrapper* and then press *Finish*.

### IDEA Build/Run configuration

We need to create a new configuration profile to run the node from IDEA.
That can be done by clicking on *Run* -> *Edit Configurations* or as shown in the following picture:

Then set the options as shown below:

- Main Class: `co.rsk.Start`
- Working directory: `/path/to/code/rskJ`
- Use classpath of module: `rskj-core_main`
- JRE need to be set as: `Default (1.8 - SDK of 'rsk-core_main' module)`

*Note:*

- If it isn't configured the default JDK, you have to set it in: *File -> Project Structure*.
- If the IDE doesn't recognize the configuration options, open `rskj/rskj-core/build.gradle` and sync it from `Gradle` tab.

### Running the node

We are ready to run the node using IDEA, just press the *Start* button at the right of the configuration we've just created.

If everything is OK, you should see the debug information like that:

And yes! Congratulations! Now you're running a local RSK node :)

You're joined to Mainnet by default.

If you want to switch the network, add:

- For Testnet: `--testnet`
- For Regtest: `--regtest`

Inside the field `Program Arguments` in your run configuration.
