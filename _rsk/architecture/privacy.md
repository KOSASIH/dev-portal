RSK does not inherently provide better transaction privacy than Bitcoin, and relies on pseudonymity. Nevertheless, the VM of RSK is [Turing-complete](/rsk/architecture/turing-complete/), and thus anonymization technologies such as CoinJoin, ring Signatures or zCash can be implemented securely without third-party trust.
