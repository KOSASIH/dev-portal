dexFreight is a decentralized FinTech-enabled logistics market network for freight companies to handle shipments from booking to payment in one place. 
dexFreight primary customers include third-party logistics providers, carriers, and shippers. dexFreight technology will ultimately translate in shorter times and lower costs to get the products to the hands of the end consumer while unlocking vast amounts of capital from freight invoices, inventories, and underused assets like trucks, trailers, warehouses, etc.
At this webinar Hector Hernadez dexFreight CSO and Co-founder will share his insights and vision on how blockchain and dexFreight are set up to revolutionize the logistics industry within the next decade.
