This error occurs when the user starts connecting its wallet and for some reason cancels it.

This error occurs if you have MetaMask and Liquality enabled.

And it will surely appear too if you do something outside the connecting process when it is happening (for example, disable the Liquality wallet extension in the middle of it).

The way to fix the two errors is the same: go to manage chrome extensions, disable any other wallet extension, disable Liquality, enable it, refresh the page app.
