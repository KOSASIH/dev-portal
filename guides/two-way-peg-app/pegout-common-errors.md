This also happens if another activity is been carried out, outside the connecting process when the connection is happening (for example, trying to disable the Liquality wallet extension in the middle of the connection).

To fix both errors: 

* Go to manage chrome extensions, and disable any other wallet extension, 
* Disable Liquality, and  enable it
* Refresh the 2 way peg app.
