## Liquidity Provider Server (LPS)

This is a [server](https://github.com/rsksmart/liquidity-provider-server) that interacts with a Liquidity Bridge Contract (LBC) to provide liquidity for users as part of the Flyover protocol. The server runs a local Liquidity Provider (LP), and also allows connections from remote LPs. See the [Configuration File](https://github.com/rsksmart/liquidity-provider-server#configuration) for LPS.

The Testnet LP Server is hosted at:
[http://flyover-01.aws-us-east-2.innovation.rskcomputing.net:8080/](http://flyover-01.aws-us-east-2.innovation.rskcomputing.net:8080/)

**System requirements:**
- go 1.16.5 or above
- DB Browser for Sqlite (or equivalent) or sqlite3 cli tool

**API**:

|gasLimit  | uint | Gas limit to use in the call |
|rskRefundAddress | address| User RSK refund address|
|bitcoinRefundAddress | bytes21 | User Bitcoin refund address. Note: Must be a legacy address, segwit addresses are not accepted |

### How to Set up LP Server Locally

See the liquidity provider [repo](https://github.com/rsksmart/liquidity-provider-server) for instructions or use the [testnet instance](http://flyover-01.aws-us-east-2.testnet.dev.flyover.rskcomputing.net:8080/) of the Liquidity Provider Server.
