## Centralised cryptocurrency exchanges

Another way to get RBTC is to use the services of centralised cryptocurrency exchanges. These are companies who provide a service which allows its users to trade between one cryptocurrency and another cryptocurrency, or a fiat currency and a cryptocurrency. These exchanges hold assets on your behalf - which means that in the case of cryptocurrencies, they operate crypto wallets on your behalf.

The way that exchanges work will be quite familiar if you have traded on a stock exchange or a foreign currency exchange before. They typically have order books to match buy and sell orders among different users, with the price of a particular pair being the last match in the order book.

### How Exchanges work

- Exchanges expose a list of **currency pairs**.
- Each currency pair is essentially a market where users can buy and sell units of one currency for units of the other currency in the pair
- Price (how many units one currency is “worth” in terms of the other)
- By default, the price is based on demand and supply of buyers vs sellers for that particular currency pair
- In some exchanges select currency pairs have their price determined by the exchange itself, which is common for currencies which are pegged, such as tokens pegged to fiat currency (stablecoins), or for cryptocurrencies pegged to each other (for example BTC and RBTC).
- Exchanges usually charge a fee each time a user buys or sells some currency
- Exchanges usually charge a fee to deposit or withdraw currency between their custodial accounts and your personal accounts

## Sending and Receiving RBTC

[RBTC is the built-in cryptocurrency of the RSK network](https://developers.rsk.co/kb/get-crypto-on-rsk/cryptocurrency-vs-token/). This means that (1) you should have a wallet that is configured to work with the RSK network, and (2) that wallet must have some RBTC if you wish to send transactions.

> Warning: A common mistake users make when interacting with exchanges is that they **confuse** RSK addresses/ wallets with Ethereum addresses/ wallets. Their addresses follow the same format, but they are otherwise incompatible. **Do not** send RBTC to an Ethereum address on an exchange. Similarly, **do not** send Ether to an RBTC address on an exchange. Your funds will be burnt (permanently lost) should you do so, as blockchain transactions are immutable, and therefore cannot be undone. It is **your own responsibility** to ensure that you are using the right wallet, and connected to the right network. RBTC can **only** be sent to and from RSK addresses on the RSK network.

The general approach to use an exchange to convert BTC to RBTC:
- Find the deposit address on the exchange on the Bitcoin network corresponding to your account on the exchange.
- Use your Bitcoin wallet to send BTC to this Bitcoin address.
- Wait for your BTC balance to appear on your account in the exchange
- Find the BTC/RBTC pair in the exchange, and sell BTC to buy RBTC
- Select a withdrawal address from your RSK wallet on the RSK network.
- Use the exchange’s user interface to withdraw RBTC to your RSK address.

Use the **user documentation from your chosen exchange** for specific guidance on how to do this.
